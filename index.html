    <p><em>Hi! Welcome to my website, I'm a self-taught Software engineer and this is my <strong>portfolio</strong>.</em></p>
    
    <p>Since I was a child I always struggle with school because I felt I did not learn anything so instead of going to the university I decided to study by myself different subjects that were of my interest. By going my own way I got to learn how to repair computers, english and music theory, but I struggle to market myself to employers since I did't had the usual degree or certification. I hope this website can change things and allow people to se what I am able to do and see if they would be interested on hiring me.</p>
